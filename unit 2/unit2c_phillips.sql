-- 1. Show each team's name and how many years old the franchise is.
--    Use 2026 as the current year. Call the column years_old.
SELECT full_name, 2026 - year_founded AS years_old
FROM teams;

-- 2. Show each team's name and a single column combining city and
--    state, like "Atlanta, Georgia". Call it location.
SELECT full_name, city || ', ' || state AS location
FROM teams;


-- 3. Show every team's full name in all uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(full_name) AS full_name
FROM teams
ORDER BY ppg DESC;

-- 4. From player_season_stats: show player_id, gp, pts, and points
--    per game (pts / gp). Only include players with more than 0 games.
SELECT player_id, gp, pts, pts / gp AS ppg
FROM player_season_stats;

-- 5. Same as query 4, but round points per game to one decimal place.
SELECT player_id, gp, pts, ROUND(pts / gp, 1) AS ppg
FROM player_season_stats;

-- 6. From team_game_stats: show each distinct season and just its
--    starting year — "2021-22" becomes "2021". Use SUBSTR.
SELECT SUBSTR(season, 0, 5)
FROM player_season_stats;

-- CHECK YOUR WORK
-- =====================================================================

-- Compare your results from queries 4 and 5. What changed?
--the 5th query looks cleaner and is a lot more compact than query 4

-- You were told to add WHERE gp > 0 before dividing. Write one more
-- query below to find out how many rows actually have gp = 0. How
-- many are there — and if the answer is what you found, why write
-- the filter at all?
--if the database ever does update it could have a zero and break everything, because you cant divide by 0

-- Calculated column: a user created column using math to find stats that otherwise arent listed


-- Concatenation (||): bars that combine groups of text
