-- 1. Using an INNER JOIN, count how many players have stats for the
--    2025-26 season.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM players p
INNER JOIN player_season_stats s
ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26'

-- 2. Using a LEFT JOIN from players, count how many rows you get for
--    the same thing.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_season_stats s
ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26'

-- 3. List the names of players who have no 2025-26 season stats.
SELECT p.full_name
FROM   players p
LEFT JOIN player_season_stats s
  ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26'
WHERE  s.player_id IS NULL;

-- 4. In movies_small.db, count how many rows in roles have no
--    character name recorded.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM movies m
INNER JOIN roles r
  ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id
WHERE r.character IS NULL;

-- 5. Show ten people from movies_small.db who have no birth year
--    recorded.
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birth_year IS NULL
LIMIT 10;

-- 6. Pick any query from this unit you found interesting, run it, and
--    export the results to CSV. Name the file
--    unit2_report_lastname.csv and commit it alongside this file.

-- Queries 1 and 2 return different numbers. What are they, and what
-- does the difference represent?
--Query 1 returns the current players for 2025-2026 and Query 2 returns the total number of players in the database

-- In query 3 you filtered with IS NULL. Which table did that NULL
-- come from, and why is it NULL?
--It came from the seasons stat and its null because they didnt play that season

-- VOCABULARY — your words, not the reference sheet's

-- LEFT JOIN: Basically combines inner join and where


-- Export: the action to get a result
